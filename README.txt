This module allows administrators to set maximum lengths for the body
fields of content types.

In HTML the textarea element does not have a maxlength attribute, so
this module is using JavaScript script to achieve this.

Install the module and then go to:
Administer / Site configuration / Maxlength
and enable maxlength for the content types that you like.
